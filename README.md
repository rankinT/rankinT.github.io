### The Old Design
#### Created for Composing Digital Media

The previous version of this portfolio was created as an assignment for my Composing Digital Media class. I used that time as an opportunity to learn how to add animations with JavaScript because it was my first time the entire front-end of a website and knew that modern design trends incorporate subtle animations to make a user experience feel more interactive and engaging.
