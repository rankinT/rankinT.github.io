						<p>
							In my free time, I like to play FPS games ranging from CSGO to
							Overwatch 2. I've been playing videogames for as long as I can
							remember and I also enjoy watching professional CSGO matches. I'm
							a competitive person and I like the tactical team aspect of these
							games. Each person has their specific responsibilities that they
							have to fulfill and everyone must cooperate for the team to win.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm also currently learning to play the guitar. It has been an
							on-and-off process. I sporadically find the motivation to try to
							learn a song from YouTube tabs and tutorials, but then I get
							caught up in other activites. The good note is that ever since my
							visual argument project, I have been putting more of a concious
							effort to remembering to practice and learn more about playing the
							guitar.
