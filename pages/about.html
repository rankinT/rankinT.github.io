						<h3>Who am I?</h3>
						<p>
							I'm Rankin! I'm a junior majoring in Digital Narrative and
							Interactive Design at Pitt because I'm fascinated by the act of
							storytelling to inspire change and connect people.
							<br />
							Well, now you know who I am. But who are you? ( •̀ .̫ •́ )✧

						<p>
							In my free time, I like to watch competitive Esports such as
							Tekken, Valorant, and more. Though, I do always find myself
							drifting back into the landscape of CSGO Esports. The storylines
							of players are transcendent beyond the scope of in-game
							performances. Watching gameplay can be impressive and exciting,
							but I love to follow the stories of emerging talent, dominant
							players, and fallen legends. Following their stories takes you on
							an unforgettable ride through celebrations, disappointment, and
							surprises all-around! (My favorite team is NAVI!)
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm also currently learning to play the guitar. I was inspired to
							finally start learning it after watching the anime K-ON and
							talking with one of my musician friends. The inner-thought that
							convinced me to commit to spending $300 on guitar pack and
							beginning the musical journey was simply telling myself...
							<br /><br />
							<em
								>"I know that if I don't do it now, I'm going to wish that I
								would've started sooner."</em
							>
							<br /><br />
							This passing thought that I had on a random day has become my
							life's mantra. Its gives me foresight into the future by
							reflecting on what would be the past, from the perspective of the
							present. So if this simple mantra gives me superpowers like Dr.
							Strange, how could I <em>not</em> follow it?
